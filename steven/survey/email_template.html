As mentioned in class, we are running a fun game to give you a hands-on experience with game theory. This fun game is about strategic behavior in paper bidding for an academic conference. The activity is optional and won’t affect your grade in any way.
<br><br>


You (along with your classmates) will play the role of a reviewer for a fictional conference called FAIC (the Fake AI Conference). To determine which papers you should review, FAIC is asking you to “bid” on various papers. See the Diderot slides <a href="https://www.diderot.one/courses/74/books/385/chapter/5150#atom-382894">here</a> for more details. The activity has two parts: 
<br><br>

<b>Part 1:</b> You play the role of an <b>honest reviewer</b> and submit bids at FAIC according to your interests. Complete this part using <a href="{link1}">this personalized link</a>.

<b>Part 2:</b> You play the role of a <b>manipulative reviewer</b> who wants to manipulate the assignment algorithm. $You are working with a group of friends to do these manipulations: <b>{group_emails}</b>. For this part, please read the instructions, discuss your strategy with your group, and then return to complete the activity. $View this part using <a href="{link2}">this personalized link</a>.
