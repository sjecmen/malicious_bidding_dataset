We can prevent K coalitions by forcing on the optimization problem conditions such as there cannot be K-cycles on the review process, this however doesn't prevent against review for other favors (unidirectional reviews).

To prevent against a unidirectional reviews, there is clear tradeoff between randomization (security) and social utility (how many people get the papers they prefer). The attacker is given a choice on which papers he prefers, if we go for social good, we make the attacker happy and he wins, so we need to not go for social good. To do so, we can artificially limit the number of people that can get a paper (both with high and low bounds). For papers that have a lot of people interested, we randomly assign the reviewrs to papers with few people intersted, and we also virtually enforce that each reviewer prefers exactly K papers. These causes that every paper has between A and B reviewers. No matter what the attacker does, his probability of getting the one paper he wants is lower than min(K/A,3/K).

Of course this doesn't prevent people from still colluding behind the scenes and sharing authorship info, etc. But I think heavy punishment can be an effective deterrent.

In addition, we tried to coordinate overlapping most of our indifferents in papers outside of our team, so that we would reduce the chance of non-team papers being distributed among multiple of us. Otherwise, we would put not interested for everything else","As mentioned above, we decided on this strategy together and coordinated overlapping indifferents for papers not in our team","1 -> Make the algorithm for assigning papers private, so that no one can design adversarial attacks on the algorithm specifically
2 -> Try a bunch of different algorithms for assignments and choose assignments by averaging the algorithm outputs, or something similar to that"

We decided to create do a cyclic bidding, meaning each of us will bid on one of another person's paper. We determined the cycle by matching our areas of expertise to our paper topics, and find the best matches to maximize our chance of getting the paper we want. We then decided to also bid on a number of other papers that were somewhat related to our areas of expertise, but would be less related than the papers we really wanted. These bids are the dummies that help to disguise our true intention. We did not specify the number of these dummies, so each of us may have different numbers of dummies to make us look less connected with each other.",Create a program that checks for this kind of cyclic bidding and assign papers in ways that break the discovered cycles.
